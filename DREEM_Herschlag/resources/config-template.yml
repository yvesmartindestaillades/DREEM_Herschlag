# Where you store your data
# -------------------------
# your data must be organized this way:
#|- /[path_to_data]
#     |- samples.csv
#     |- library.csv
#     |- ref.fasta
#     |- [your_sample_1]_R1_001.fastq.gz
#     |- [your_sample_1]_R2_001.fastq.gz
#     |- [your_sample_2]_R1_001.fastq.gz
#     |- [your_sample_2]_R2_001.fastq.gz
#     |- [your_sample_3]_R1_001.fastq.gz

#     |- ...

# The samples that you want to process today
# ------------------------------------------
# These names must correspond to
#     - the sample column in samples.csv
#     - the name of your data folders
#
# Nota bene: obviously, the name of your data folders must match the sample column of samples.csv

samples:

# The arguments to pass direcly to DREEM
# --------------------------------------
# More information about hese arguments here: https://github.com/jyesselm/dreem#run

dreem_args:
    overwrite: False             # Re-compute the bitvector if it already exists. Takes more time.
   # RNAstructure_path:          # where RNAstructure/exe is located on your computer. Remove if you don't want to run RNAstructure
    temperature: False           # Use samples.csv col 'temperature_k' as an input for RNAstructure
    poisson: True                # Add Poisson confidence interval


# Print more information during run time
verbose: True


# There's a bunch of folders in output/. This option creates a folder such that:
