# Where you store your data
# -------------------------
# your data must be organized this way:
#|- /[path_to_data]
#     |- samples.csv
#     |- library.csv
#     |- ref.fasta
#     |- [your_sample_1]_R1_001.fastq.gz

#     |- [your_sample_2]_R1_001.fastq.gz

# The samples that you want to process today
# ------------------------------------------
# These names must correspond to
#     - the sample column in samples.csv
#     - the name of your data folders
#
# Nota bene: obviously, the name of your data folders must match the sample column of samples.csv
